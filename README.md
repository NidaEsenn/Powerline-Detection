# ⚡ Powerline Detection for Rotary-Wing Aircraft

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents a **real-time powerline detection system** aimed at increasing the safety of rotary-wing aircraft such as **helicopters and drones**.  
Electrical powerlines are among the most dangerous obstacles for low-altitude flights due to their **thin structure, poor visibility in certain weather conditions, and incomplete database records**.  

By leveraging **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, this project achieves **~96% accuracy** in detecting powerlines from camera sensor images in real time.  
The system is designed to be **low-cost, accessible, and practical** for integration into lightweight aerial vehicles.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Training Set:** 10,000 RGB images (128×128 resolution)  
  - 5,417 with powerlines  
  - 4,583 without powerlines  
- **Test Set:** 4,007 independent images (different from the training set)  

The dataset covers **diverse environments and perspectives**, ensuring model robustness.
